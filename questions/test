Hello, I have graduated from the University of Toronto, and have been working in the software engineering industry for the past 10 years.
Now, I mainly focus on application development in JavaScript and Python. I've been part of large companies, as well as developing a startup company with small teams.
I've used ChatGPT extensively recently for various prompts, including specific programming language prompts and integrating AI's output within real applications.
I've taken prompt engineering courses for ChatGPT and Midjourney specifically.

First, it reads the input text file completely, and constructs a dictionary that has key as integer and value as string, each entry corresponds to a single line in the file. The purpose is to index all encoded words and their corresponding integer code.
Second, use the dictionary from the first step to output a string that only contains the values corresponding to the pyramid's rightmost number. This number can be calculated with the arithmetic series formula.

First of all, in B the English explanation of the process is more succinct and clear.
Second, B's solution is correct, where the step and subsets variables are updated correctly per iteration of the loop, resulting in correct progression.
A's solution is incorrect, in that the step variable's initialization is within the while loop, and is unable to correctly slice the input in each iteration.

Function A is the most efficient because it has O(sqrt(n)) time cost and no space cost, whereas B has O(n) space cost and O(n) time cost, similarly C has O(n) time cost.

Solution B is accurate because it works for all lengths of the input, whereas the other solutions only work for length of 3.
